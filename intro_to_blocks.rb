# a block is a collection of code to be exectuted
# a block is not an object, one of few things thats not an object
# its a attachment that follows a method call - cannot exist without a method
# it changes/alters the method 
# not an argument or parameter
# defined by {} or a do end


evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

evens.each { |number| puts number ** 3}


colors = ["Red", "Purple", "Green", "Blue"]

statements = colors.map { |color| "#{color} is a great color."}

puts statements
# Red is a great color.           .map returns a new array for each element it passes over
# Purple is a great color.
# Green is a great color.
# Blue is a great color.











# # the yield keyword

# the yield keyword transfers control from the method to the block that
# is attached to the method call (see below for example)
# yield stops the methods exectution and the method waits until the block is done doing 
# whatever it is designed/listed to do within it, then starts back up


def pass_control
  puts "This is inside the method!"
  yield # pass control from the method to the block
  puts "Now the method has started up again"
end

# This is inside the method!
# Now I'm inside the block!

# # PROCS I

# a proc is an object similiar to a block
# but they are meant to be reused
# does not care about arguments and is entirely self contained


# Say we wanted to retun an array that took each element in a given array and cube them **3

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
c = [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# we could...

# a_cubes = a.map { |num| num ** 3 }      #[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
# b_cubes = b.map { |num| num ** 3 }      #[216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
# c_cubes = c.map { |num| num ** 3 }      #[1331, 1728, 2197, 2744, 3375]

# but dont want to create nearly identical processes for many things
# not efficient

# So we can design a proc for our program to run
# begin proc at the top
# to call on the proc we need to use the ampersand & inside the argument

cubes = Proc.new { |number| number ** 3 }

# we can nest arrays within an array
# not much less writing but it looks sexy
