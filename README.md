 Beginner programming stuff

 Just learning the code, here's to hoping I can program with the tools I'm given!

 google, amazon, linkedin, not facebook... if you're beyond impressed as I'm sure you will be, feel free to email me at dcraderdev@gmail.com

 Everyone else, just have your people contact my people and they'll go over the details on my rates and requirements (ie company car, daily masseuse visits, maybe a little background on the project?)
